USER: the right circle
SYSTEM: Okay, based on what you've said there should be two half-circle dials and the slider should point to green. So you should set both pointers to the middle position.
USER: the left one is correct, the right one is not
SYSTEM: Could you please slow down a bit? I can't keep track with so much info at once! Please tell me only one thing at a time.
USER: what is the right circle slider?

USER: yes
SYSTEM: How many dials are there on the control panel? There might be one or two of them.
USER: two
SYSTEM: If I have this correct, there are two half-circle dials and the slider is set to green. This means you should set the pointers of both dials to the middle position.
USER: Incorrect.  
SYSTEM: Did that work?
USER: It did not work
SYSTEM: Are you sure that there are two half dials, and the slider color is green?
USER: Slider color is yellow
SYSTEM: Okay, which number is the left dial pointing at?
USER: Left dial is at 15
SYSTEM: Can you tell me where the pointer on the right dial is pointing to? To the left, right or middle?
USER: Right dial is 19
SYSTEM: If I have this correct, there are two half-circle dials, the slider is not green, the left dial points to an odd number, and the right dial points to the right. This means you should set the left dial pointer one position to the right, and the right dial pointer one position to the left.
USER: Correct
SYSTEM: Did that work?
USER: Slider now green
SYSTEM: If I have this correct, there are two half-circle dials and the slider is set to green. So you should set both pointers to the middle position.
USER: Correct
SYSTEM: Did it work?
